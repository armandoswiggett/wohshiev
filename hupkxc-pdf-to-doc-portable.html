Last year I was given an opportunity to port a commercial DOS game from 1991 to Windows. More excitingly, it was a game from my childhood. I would like to talk about how I was able to license the source code, some of the more major quirks of porting 28 year old C code to Windows 10, and a bit about it’s release. I would also that to chat about some of the accomplishments/mistakes I made during the last year.

FYI after posting this we had some good feedback: https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents.html I'm going to investigate whether we can make the internal PHZ format fully compatible with ePub 3.0.1. I think it could be possible. Probably 95% certain. The only catch is whether we can add extended metadata but I imagine we can as I could just add my own files with custom polar-specific metadata that would just be ignored by anyone else.

Hey all. I'm thinking about getting a Chromebook after deciding I want a cheap and simple portable option for note-taking, PDF usage, Google Docs usage, annotating, and the like while I'm in class or the university library. I'm looking at this Samsung Chromebook (https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Dual-Core-upgradable-Bluetooth/dp/B07KCX7HXD) and it seems it would meet my preferences quite well (even has USB). There's no mention of stylus compatibility in the specs. I saw a few posts. Hi all, I need something portable and convenient for online schooling (Blackboard). It's mostly reading, videos, and assignments (doc/pdf files to fill in, some 2-3 page papers to write, discussion posts). Any help would be appreciated. I am a new assistant professor and just did the SURS retirement choice plan seminar. I cannot decide between the Portable and the Self-Managed Plan (SMP). Does anyone here have advice or where to look? I could not find recommendations on the SURS website or anywhere else really.

I originally had this post as "new Seagate SSDs" but have quickly realized a lot more would be revealed at CES, so this is being reposted as a general post. I will update this as new information is known. Seagate announced several different SSDs at CES and I felt it was worthwhile to make a post exploring these options before they arrive on the market. These will be separated by target/type. Mobile SSD: LaCie Mobile SSD (https://www.lacie.com/products/mobile-ssd/). This has a USB-C/3.1. Reading books, magazines and documents can be very stressful for the eyes. Apart from that, accumulating can be very intimidating, as a person loses interest in reading even before the task starts. Fortunately, there is a way to arouse your interest in learning new things without having to buy a book or turn a page. With a program called Text-to-Speech software, you can easily convert documents to .doc, PDF or .txt so you can easily store and listen to them in your MP3 player.

Here's the deal, dudes: If I can pass these, so can you. I did help-desk from age 16-24 then left the industry. Got all jobs without certs--it was a different time back then. After 5 years out (a lifetime in tech) I'm coming back to IT.

The official autopsy report for JFK, written days after his death and post-mortem, reads: gtThe projectiles were fired from a point behind and somewhat above the level of the deceased. https://www.maryferrell.org/showDoc.html?docId=584#relPageId=6amptab=page The report was written by Dr. James Humes of Bethesda Naval Hospital, the lead autopsy surgeon who handled Kennedy's body after it was flown to Bethesda, Maryland from Dallas, Texas. The autopsy report was partially based on notes. I saw older Motorola XTS 1500 VHF radios at an auction. They are deprogrammed and used to be used by the police.
