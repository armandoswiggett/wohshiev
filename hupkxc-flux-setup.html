                            <p>AKVIS Sketch — программа для создания рисунка из фотографии. том, что AKVIS Sketch дает удивительно качественный результат, похожий на ручную. Working on a side project where I have the rails app separate from the flux application. I simply use config file for browserify to put the bundle.js file into the rails app's asset pipeline. However, I would like to leverage react-rails to do server side rendering of the JSX templates. The problem is, a lot of modules are loaded from npm packages, such as keymirror, react-merge, events, etc. The last one being part of the browserify package. I can grab these files directly, and remove require. I'm interested to know what other people are using for user authentication to the Kubernetes API (e.g. for `kubectl` access). Are people mostly using the built-in Kubernetes authentication options like client certificates, or something external based follow this community because I enjoy all the trades subs, and have been wanting to learn how to do some simple welding myself. I get paid on Friday and was thinking about picking up something to start practicing. was hoping you guys could point me in the right direction as far as what's cheap/easy to learn for someone with no experience (besides brazing copper to copper).  What is the easiest way to get praecantio. Okay, so I’ve rerouted the coolant lines to my compressor valve. No problems there, although I figured I’d have a couple. After the reroute, my GXT-477 capacitor started to fluctuate. And not just a little bit. The proton flux levels were way off the charts. So I guess my question is how do I get such an old (but still reliable) capacitor to yield lower proton flux levels?? I’m trying to stay off the grid here. Can’t emphasize that enough. Should I just upgrade my GXT-477? Or maybe add another. This winter I want to try and tackle some rust on my '93 Miata, mostly located along my rocker panels. I have a friend who is willing to sell me a harbor freight 125 flux welder, plus a face mask, gloves, and a cart he made for 5. Seems like a solid deal, so I'm probably going to jump on it. I've heard that flux welding isn't great for body panels because it can burn through the metal, especially for an inexperienced welder (I have never even touched a welder in my life). 
Hi, I was trying to install f.lux recently and I get this error: 'ERROR: Checksum for 'C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\chocolatey\f.lux.12\flux-setup.exe' did not meet '2696C35394CA9125098458FC080461B6C841D6D8FD263B40270D21A8823C65B0' for checksum type 'sha256'. Consider passing the actual checksums through with --checksum --checksum64 once you validate the checksums are appropriate. A less secure option is to pass --ignore-checksums if necessary. The install of f.lux was NOT successful. Can anyone help me understand why my Flux network is only partially working? https://imgur.com/a/ph6QT36 I have the Plug on a Reactor linking to an Point on a smaller reactor then linking to a Capacitor bank, and a wireless charger, it is wirelessly charging my Jetpack but nothing else is receiving power. THE GOAL: Playing Destiny in the evening hours without compromising precious, precious Zzzz's. THE CHALLENGE: Doing it on my existing Macbook Pro hardware and not spending a fortune on new hardware. THE SOLUTION:  is for /r/DestinyTheGame to provide. The MBP has mini displayport in/out. I figure I'd need to run the set up not unlike how a Twitch streamer would have the PS4 running to a graphics card, then back out to the TV. Something like. PS4 -gt External Capture Device. 
Howdy. I'm trying to figure out how to connect everything up to a flux condenser to get rid of all the spooky stuff happening constantly in my main base, so that I can make sure I stop spawning rifts inside of my infusion room. I've drawn up a little diagram to show my initial setup -- which isn't working -- so someone can tell me where I went wrong. https://imgur.com/a/ml8BfFH - A single lattice (for now), attached to the top of the flux condenser - An empty warded jar, directly attached. Installed a prebuilt fused clapton. Single coil configuration. 28GAx2 with 32GA wrap kanthal. Coil reads at .54 and at 35w has a reading of 4.33v on a variable mod. Checked that it is evenly firing. Problem now is that even at a low wattage the vape is too hot either burning my lip or tongue, sometimes there are spit backs as well. Is there a way to solve this? I tried adjusting the wattage lower (at 30-33ish), it is a bit cooler but the vapor production is weaker and can barely taste Since many are asking the same thing. I guess I should make a collection post for tips. # Start To start, you will need to mine some vis crystal (three kinds of them at least), then take a sleep. Upon wake up you will get a book. Then you can start from there. Don't mine the whole vein tho, as they will grow and spread (in theory, I didn't experience that in my games). I will also suggest you to get some quartz too. # Research Blocks nearby your research table (5 block within) So, my favorite truck at the moment, an HPI Blitz, has an issue. It has a Dynamite Tazer 3300 setup in it with 45A waterproof ESC (I got it as a roller, hence I don't have the Flux setup that was stock), a Dynamite 4000mAh 20C 2S lipo, and a gear ratio of 8.63, which is possible through a pinion gear of 25 teeth and a spur of 83. It's great, I mean it really hauls ass, with one problem. If I run it for a few seconds at full throttle, like 5-6 seconds, it's fine, but afterwards, and sometimes. I'd like to teach myself welding, and I have a few projects in mind ( like a smoker, a weight stand for 250lbs of weights) I think I can do this with a MIG flux setup, but I'd like to ask you guys first. I've read that it's the simplest to learn and good enough for those projects? I saw a Lincoln Electric Flux 120V Flux core welder on clearance at Lowes. Is that a good setup So I try installing an app via wine and this is what happens: administrator@AdminMint ~ $ wine /home/administrator/Downloads/flux-setup.exe wine: Unhandled page fault on write access to 0x00000171 at address 0x7bc4717b (thread 0009), starting debugger. err:seh:raise_exception Unhandled exception code c0000005 flags 0 addr 0x7bc4717b Please help me identify what is wrong.
